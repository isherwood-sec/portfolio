Welcome to my resume! I have broad experience in a variety of cyber security related domains such as incident response, security architecture and engineering, architecture review, SIEM engineering, vulnerability management, and detection engineering.

I have experience in training new cyber security analysts, writing how-to's and runbook type documents, and enabling analysts to work smarter not harder. In my various places of work, I've also frequently been a point of contact for career mentoring.

Regarding consulting, I have experience presenting to leadership, writing statements of work, and executing and delivering on said work. Areas of expertise are blue team centric: SOC training, automation, process improvement, alert creation, tool validation, product onboarding, etc.

Thanks for stopping by!
